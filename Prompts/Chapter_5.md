Using Copilot for Security's Generic plugin, can you evaluate the listening ports from your previous output and identify the applications or services running on this device associated with these listening ports?

```
Listening ports on a device help to identify which services are open and actively waiting for incoming connections. Each service typically uses a specific port number, helping to determine the nature of the service based on the port being listened to. For example, if a device has a listening port on port 3389, it typically means that it is running the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP). With this information, using Copilot for Security's Generic plugin, can you evaluate the listening ports from your previous output
and identify the applications or services that are open and actively waiting for incoming connections.
